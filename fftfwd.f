       SUBROUTINE FFTFWD(A,M)
! COMPUTES AND RETURNS THE FORWARD FFT.  THIS IS BASICALLY THE ONE TAKEN
! FROM OPPENHEIM AND SCHAFER, PAGE 331.
! ARGUMENTS:
! A - THE COMPLEX INPUT ARRAY TO BE TRANSFORMED.  THIS IS ALSO THE OUTPUT!!
! M - THE POWER OF 2 OF THE FFT.  THERE MUST BE 2**M COMPLEX POINTS IN A.
